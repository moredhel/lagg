## What is it?

This is a tool which reads an input (stdin, file) and aggregates the values, scoring them and outputs them in (near) realtime.


## Why?

I find I'll be tailing some logs in a high-traffic scenario & I want to be able to be able to quickly see if any errors are bubbling up on a frequent basis.



## Caution

This tool has not been extensively tested when being piped into other tools (such as awk), so handle with care.


## Contributing

Please! This is a quick & naive solution that I hacked together to scratch an itch, refinements & improvements are always appreciated
